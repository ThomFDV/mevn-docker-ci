# MEVN Docker

A fullstack project boilerplate with docker containers to start up your development as fast as possible.

**M** : MongoDB with Mongoose

**E** : Express to build the API

**V** : Vuejs and Vue Material for the frontend

**N** : Nodejs for the backend

### Get Started

Clone the project, then run the docker-compose file and have fun !

```bash
cd mevn-docker
docker-compose up --build
```

You should see the frontend at `http://localhost:8080`.

Work in progress to enhance the project structure.
